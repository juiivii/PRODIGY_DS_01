Data Visualization: Bar Charts and Histograms

This project focuses on creating bar charts and histograms to visualize the distribution of categorical or continuous variables, such as ages or genders in a population. 
The data is extracted from Wikipedia through web scraping, and preprocessing is performed to clean and structure the data. 
Visualizations are generated using matplotlib, pandas, and seaborn.
